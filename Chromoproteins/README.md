# Package: Chromoprotein Collection

A collection of iGEM Registry chromoproteins from Team Uppsala, useful for reporters and projects that require pigments (dyes, bio-art, etc.). This collection should be expanded upon to include chromoproteins outside of the iGEM Registry, particularly newly developed ones.
