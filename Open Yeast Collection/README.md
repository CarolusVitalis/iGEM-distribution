# Package: Open Yeast Collection

Currently, there are no truly free open source synthetic biology toolkits for engineering yeast. This inhibits innovation and restricts access to these powerful organisms as platforms for biotechnology. The Open Yeast Collection is a free and open DNA toolkit for engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, enabling anyone to have a complete and robust toolkit to build new metabolic pathways or produce enzymes and proteins of interest.
